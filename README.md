# Context

This repository contains [a vision](./csvw-vision.md) for how CSVW and
linked data can support each other, and issues uncovered in the CSVW
specifications in relation to that vision.

It is easy to read the standards, or to look at some metadata document
examples and believe you understand them and know how they work.
Unfortunately this is not the case, the CSVW standards are complex,
hard to read, and surprising. They do little to present the big
picture. There are many subtleties with wide ranging implications.

We are coming at this from the perspective of trying to find
solutions, which can help align CSVW with the wider ideals of linked
data. Whether that is through work arounds, extensions or updates
through the standardisation process.

First read:

- [What is the annotated table model?](./notes/001-what-is-the-annotated-table-model.md) to clear up some misconceptions on this topic.
- [A vision for CSVW](./csvw-vision.md) for context and background on
  what we hope to achieve.

Then consider the issues:

1. [Alignment Problems](./issues/001-aligning-linked-data-and-annotated-table.md)
2. [Template Evaluation is "weird"](./issues/002-template-evaluation.md)

I hope many of these issues can be further clarified, and I can be
corrected on a misinterpretation of the specifications. However I
believe these issues are fundamental issues with the specifications
(or what we expect from them) and deserving of discussion. Hopefully
we can find resolutions or appropriate work arounds.

We want to work with the CSVW community to solve these issues, though
I believe there are some fundamental problems with the standards, it
is also my belief that they can be resolved.
