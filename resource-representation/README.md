# Resource, Representation and Service Alignment

This is a simplified example showing how we could define an aligned
cube from multiple CSVW representations. It is intentionally NOT
complete, as it aims to focus discussion on alignment of
representations and resource.

The file [./resource-rep.ttl](resource-rep.ttl) describes the main
layout of data and how things might work. It also shows how such a
dataset may be append only and logically built from immutable parts.

The separate parts of the dataset and its representation all exist in
the [./doc](./doc) directory.
