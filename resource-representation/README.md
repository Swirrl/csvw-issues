# Resource, Representation and Service Alignment

This is a simplified example showing how we could define an aligned
cube from multiple CSVW representations.

The file [./resource-rep.ttl](resource-rep.ttl) describes the main
layout of data and how things might work. It also shows how such a
dataset may be append only and logically built from immutable parts.
